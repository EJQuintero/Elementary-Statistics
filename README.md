# Elementary-Statistics
I decided to write my own Python code to perform basic Statistical operations, rather than importing from 'Statistic' or 'Math' libraries. 
The purpose of my work is to practice Python coding and use Object Oriented Programming to execute Statistics. 
These pages do not represent CS industry best practices. 
The code in this pages only demostrate my train of thought when approaching statistical problems, and how I decided to break down the process into smaller smaller buckets of work (or code in this instance).
