'''nCx is a notation to represent the possible combinations leading to success trials given the number of trials.
For example: calculate the number of ways to obtain two (2) heads in a four-toss (4) coin game 
(formula: nCx = n! / (n - x)! * x!).
Calculating the nCx is required for the cumulative probability distribution function. The first step is to create a
factorial (!) function to be use in the nCx. Then, use the factorial function to calculate the nCx (where n is the
total number of trials, and x the number of successful trials).'''

# Create a factorial function
def factorial(variable):
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, variable + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial

# use the factorial function in the nCx formula (nCx = n! / (n - x)! * x!
def nCx(n, x):
    nCx = factorial(n) / (factorial(n - x) * factorial(x))
    return int(nCx)
